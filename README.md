# Vent

> Visualized Education NTNU

Vent is a visualization tool for educational data based around the [VSON](https://github.com/hernil/vson) format. The two main components, its front and back end are loosely coupleded. 

The front end can easily perform visualizations from any source prividing VSON data. 

The back end is a framework on which to build integrations between existing data stores and the front end by connecting with source data and converting it to VSON. 

Vent and VSON was developed as my master thesis in the spring of 2018 at the Norwgian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). 

It is released under the MIT license. Note however that the front end leverages Highcharts which comes with its own [license](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/blob/master/license.txt). 

Future development or maintanance is left up to the community and the team of [Michail Giannakos](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/michailg) at NTNU.
